# DateSorter
Basic date sorter utilising Java Swing. Open-Source/Free Use

## Purpose
During the CS2020 "Software Programming" module at the University of Aberdeen, the class was exposed to Swing and were taught the fundamentals of how to utilise it. In this project, I aimed to improve upon the skills developed in that course, specifically familiarising myself with new layout managers including the GridLayout in order to make future application layouts more versatile and scalable.

## Documentation
Comments are missing from this project, and as such, users intending to utilise this code for their own projects should take the time to fully understand the underlying processes behind the code. During the Software Programming course, we were strongly urged to familiarise ourselves with Java documentation and the OpenJDK repository to improve our fundamental understanding: this I will pass forward.

## Final Remarks
This project is but a small test of new layout managers, and is not fully secure. As such, any industrial users should take appropriate caution when pulling code from this repository. That being said, please do look around.
